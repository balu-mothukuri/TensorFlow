Model which classifies images in a MNIST dataset using Tensor Flow.

1. Load the MNIST dataset from keras API
2. Split in to training and testing data
3. Normalize the input data
4. Define the model - no of layers, inputs and outputs. Set the optimizer and the loss function
5. Use model.fit() to train and evaluate MNIST dataset
6. Use callbacks to stop training once accuracy reaches a certain threshold.
